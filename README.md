# hello-world
just to say hello to the world of github


I am a student from SCUT,which lies in china.What I want to be is a cracker,a person with lots of coding skills and knowledge.
However,I just have learned coding for half a year.That is why I come here,hoping to learn more from github with all the peoplo here.

  after a half year,I am back.
